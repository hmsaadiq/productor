# BACKEND .GITIGNORE: This file tells git which files/folders to ignore in the Firebase Functions backend.
# It helps prevent committing build artifacts, dependencies, and sensitive files.
#
# Design Patterns: Uses the Ignore pattern for version control hygiene.
# Data Structures: Uses plain text patterns.
# Security: Prevents sensitive or unnecessary files from being tracked in git.
